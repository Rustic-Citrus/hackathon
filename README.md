## Abstract

As part of a hackathon event in collaboration with Digital Futures and HorizonX Consulting, our team was instructed to create a comparison website for large-language models (LLM's), so that regulated industries could identify which models were best suited for their needs. We were given approximately ten days to complete the project, at the end of which, our team presented the results to the stakeholder, a representative from HorizonX Consulting. 

During the task, several team members faced extenuating circumstances, which meant that some areas were under-developed. Nevertheless, the collaborative experience was positive, and each of us took away professional lessons from the project. Finally, we were able to present a minimum viable product (MVP) which met some, if not all, of the stakeholder's requirements.

## Instructions

The frontend of the project, which was developed by Harry and Gwen, is a React application developed using the Vite build tool. To run the project, you will need to have Git and Node Package Manager installed on your local machine. Then, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project to the desired location on your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rustic-Citrus/hackathon.git
```
2. Open a new terminal in the `hackathon` directory or change directory using the `cd` command:
```bash
cd hackathon
```
3. Install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Start a local development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
5. Navigate to `localhost:5173` in your browser to see the application.
